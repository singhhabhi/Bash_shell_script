<< 'MULTILINE-COMMENT'
The plates will still shift
and the clouds will still spew.
The sun will slowly rise
and the moon will follow too.

Lifeâ€™s beauty will continue
to flourish all around,
but now you are gone,
these birds have no sound.

And my heart does not beat.
It is still inside my chest.
My tears keep on falling
and my head will not rest.

But I have no choice only
to move through this life.
Endlessly attempting
to fill this longing that is rife.
MULTILINE-COMMENT
